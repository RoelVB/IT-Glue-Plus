# IT Glue Plus

Unofficial Chrome extension for automatically entering credentials into websites from IT Glue (based on [ChromeKeePass](https://github.com/RoelVB/ChromeKeePass)).

The goal of this project is to create a more user friendly extension instead of the official IT Glue Extension. Because, in my opinion, it leaves a lot to desire.
